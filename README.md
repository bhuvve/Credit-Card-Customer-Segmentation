# Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation

### Problem Statement
RBLâ€™s marketing department collects various customer specific data of the credit card holders. They need a mechanism to segment the customer based on underlying characteristics and form market clusters which will be easy for them to target and provide product ideas to the management. Currently these tasks are performed manually by trusting the judgment of experts in the field. These can lead to human error, biased decision and other factors which may not be helpful to create a customer cluster that actually exist. They want to design a system that would automate this process and help the different stakeholders to make informed business decision.

### Objective
- To develop a solution focused on developing a clustering algorithm based on unsupervised learning. 
- Try various clustering algorithm, and identify the best model for the business scenario and build and fine tune them based on characteristics. 
- Deploy the machine learning model using Flask API and pickle files. 
- Design a UI for entering model inputs and display results accordingly.-
